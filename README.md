# A Project Management App Created using React & Firebase

This Project was created while I was learning React via The Net Ninja's course on Udemy - https://www.udemy.com/course/build-web-apps-with-react-firebase

On Top of what I built with the instructor, I added Responsiveness to this project so that it works well on smaller screens. Also added loaders in the UI wherever required. 

Here is the Live Project - https://managerrr-30a16.web.app/
